## Overview
The **Indian IPTV App** is a comprehensive platform that allows users to stream over 500 Indian TV channels directly from their devices. The app provides a seamless streaming experience with a wide variety of channels, including news, entertainment, sports, movies, and regional content.

## Learning Purpose
This project is developed with the primary aim of learning and improving our skills in mobile application development. The project serves as a practical example of how to implement IPTV streaming features in an Android app, including integrating multiple channels, managing streaming quality, and creating a user-friendly interface.

By working on this app, we aim to:
- Enhance our understanding of Android development using Java and Kotlin.
- Improve our skills in integrating streaming services using IPTV technology.
- Learn about the design and implementation of user interfaces that support multiple languages and categories.
- Gain experience in handling large amounts of data, such as managing and updating a list of 500+ channels.
- Understand best practices for app performance optimization, particularly for streaming apps.
